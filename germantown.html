        <summary><i>chapter <b>one</b> introduces us to esther, a broke woman who just needs eight hours in a real bed.</i></summary>
        <p><pre>
          nobody’s sure where the snakes came from, though one is lime-green and 
	          “has a Latin-American tongue,” says the broad-shouldered man through 
	  a phone call cradled in a rolled dress-shirt sleeve and stainless watch. 
	          “But are we sure she isn’t British, then?”—checkout lady, scanning 
	  his green juice. She’s hoop earrings, friendship bracelet, and her mascara 
	  is acne underneath a pair of grey, oceanic eyes. It’s fall, she whispers as 
	  an overcast Wednesday festers in the parking lot. Tomorrow is her thirtieth 
          birthday, and her tenth-floor double bed in a germantown apartment building 
	  will be empty as her alarm sounds. Her landlord will call her a bitch through 
	  her voicemail, and then on a letter through her door; he litters her phone 
	  with messages until her bike is discovered beside the boardwalk. 
	          The headline on Friday’s Times will reveal to the businessmen, 
	  night-shifters and nursing-home regulars that the snakes were discovered 
	  among the apples and pears. A spokesman for Manitoba Shipping stuck his index 
	  finger to God during a press conference and decried that as the little guy, 
	  lowly middlemen, etc… <i>how could they have known?</i> Panama and the Caribbean 
          deny custody, and the cellular signal throughout Central America is speckled 
	  like measles as the financially-afflicted call their lawyers, accountants and 
	  buddies. The brother and sister disappear without cause by eight-o-clock a.m. 
	  on a humid morning, and Monday’s Times tile germantown bus-stops as the work-
	  struck gag on smog, exhaust and heart-burn, and grasp at 10pt letter-type. 
	          Esther slides a ten-dollar bill to the checkout lady, and smiles yellow, 
	  twice-brushed teeth as she asks for a receipt. 
	          “How about those snakes, huh,” checkout sighs, catches Esther’s raised 
	  eyebrow, chuckles that “they found a pair of snakes in the fruit, a boy and a 
	  girl—couldn’t get ‘em apart, or get ‘em even, so they slipped under a refrigerator—”
	          “Which one,” Esther, in a breath—
	          “Meat, I guess, but it was a half-hour ago, they’ll be in South America, 
	  by now.” 
	          “Fuck,” as Esther swipes the vacuum-sealed frankfurters from checkout 
	  and screams out the door in recycled sneakers and printer-paper cap. The stall 
	  is chained to the bike-rack, as she left her, and the umbrella cat-calls her as 
	  a gust sweeps across the asphalt. 
	          The parking lot is crickets, forty-two spaces and a manager’s Honda. His 
	  name is Lassie (red-headed complexion, sleepy eyelids) and is fitted with pleather 
	  diarrhoea and a dashcam nose-piercing which overhears
	          <i>i’ve lost romeo and juliet in the supermarket no i don’t know where a 
	  fucking refrigerator it’s your fault stupid fucking names of course they ran off 
	  together oh go and fuck yourself drop off the thing halfway across town and pay my 
	  fucking subway fare maybe yeah i’ll leave the franks on the stall with the keys too 
	  and a big arrow with three dollar signs and why not my address too you can mail me 
	  a severance check and turn off the stupid fucking voice changer i know you sound 
	  like snot-nosed orson fucking welles </i>
	          and loses Esther to the sidewalk. She is a free-loader, less than pond 
          scum of the earth, sleeps four hours each night on a yoga mat, sleeps with a guy 
	  whose name she doesn’t know but her high school friend once did, on his closet 
	  kitchen floor. The guy naps six hours (two-through-eight a.m.), then dissolves 
	  into a storm drain and street lights the other eighteen. His hair, eyes and skin 
	  are grey (she believes) but he doesn’t pay his bills, so he might be only a trick 
	  of a dim September light, a phantom swept through the apartment’s window in a 
	  plume of small-hour rain. 
	          She weighs self-care and medication as she seethes over concrete, leaps 
	  over boiling dribbling sewer-grate. A crosswalk traffic light slams into her, wakes 
	  her up with a ticklish throat and unemployment. Epiphany soaks through her goosebumps, 
	  nails and bones like ice-water. She understands that she is worse than slinging hot-
	  dogs to the homeless and melancholic, that she is worse than her boss, a twenty-
	  something landlord of a fast-food cart, amateur dolittle and soul-patched wretch. 
	  She resolves to nap for seven hours and drink. She recognises that Esther Jones 
	  dies for twelve hours, and who gives a damn about tomorrow; that the dead live, 
	  even as their eyes spill into a gutter, dry and rot. 
	          A pale hand waves her over the zebra stripes. Esther skips across them, a 
	  ballet atop stepping stones as she hums a hopscotch tune.

      	<summary><i>chapter <b>two</b> is tuneful, hopeful, and shamelessly unoriginal.</i></summary>
	<p><pre>
	<i>rats camp out underneath the cooker, so she doesn’t own an alarm clock and occasionally, 
	she can’t drift off without a nightlight, but greyscale’s closet doesn’t possess a single 
	unoccupied outlet, so she doesn’t own a nightlight, though she gets by with the broiler 
	and his frozen pizzas</i>
		Esther’s text-tone is a barbed pillow and smothers her awake. Bed-head spits 
	all-American crumbs and dairy product onto her phone screen as she skims Lewis’ text asking 
	her out to <i>sharps and flats</i> in a half hour. <i>She’ll be there</i> and tosses her 
	phone into the kitchen sink.
		A cloud weeps over her as she descends to the sidewalk. Her Amber Leaf pouch is in her 
	fleece, her lighter is in her leather jacket. <i>Does it even matter?</i> A raindrop tears 
	across her cheek. <i>sharps and flats</i> is three blocks down 1st ave; by then, she’ll be 
	a wet dog, piss-stained, yapping and spreading pneumonia. Big-brother cloud yells at her as 
	she splits 1st ave along the diagonal, and vomits onto her hair. Rain screeches against 
	tenement block and fire-escape until she’s carded by the bouncer and flees the claustrophobic 
	outdoor air. 
		Lewis is a faggot, as usual, nursing a pinot and a thimble of olives on a stool at the 
	bar. The bouncer scratches her state ID 
		<i>no she doesn’t own a car no she can’t afford one no she can’t drive</i>
		and Esther’s eyes pour through the window and drift onto him, strumming his incisors 
	with a toothpick. 
		“I’ve left the green olives for you” he grins. She orders a strong vodka diet soda water 
	and climbs onto the bar stool, crosses her denim legs,
		“and here’s a toothpick” up his knotted sweater sleeve, “and here’s a lighter” from a 
	corduroy slack pocket “like a white rabbit with trapped gas” <i>ha ha ha</i>, he laughs, sighs 
	“you looked like you needed one.”
		“Thank you, Lewis,” she sips, breathes “I mean it, and do you believe in back-rests, by 
	the way?” 
		“I couldn’t get a reservation, for a table, I mean, but the big guy Chuck is a college 
	friend’s roommate, so—”
		“—so the bar, I get it, sure,” pops an olive, then a garlic clove
		(Newsprint footnote a week yesterday in a quarter-dollar dishrag informed germantowners 
	that a bespoke knife shop slept in an alley just aside 1st ave and had frozen to death last 
	winter. <i>sharps and flats</i> was his name, ran an eight-bar radio jingle in the eighties—
	first four bars in B flat, last four in B sharp. Chuck Manson is a pair of aviators with grey 
	streamers and starved toothbrush moustache who bought the place from a limping tombstone and 
	retrofitted the room into a jazz bar and let him keep his old name. Chuck is the owner, manager 
	and <i>curator</i>. The piece inflicted a weekday pandemic of mass hysteria upon germantown, 
	symptoms being: shortness of breath and hiccups, brought on by a sudden gasp; dehydration, 
	theorised to originate from an unceasing teary eye; nostalgia, and regret. Esther and the million-
	dollar babies are the only survivors.) 
		as she orders herself a strong vodka diet soda water, a top-knotted bartender is saucer-
	eyed and draws the emptied thimble beneath the bar-top.
		“What’s wrong, bud?” Lewis is a spotlight with pale teeth and a steaming pink sheet-metal 
	hand, but
		<i>her stomach moans her armhairs and ears burn she counts her heart’s steps divides by 
	sixty and</i>
		sips, breathes, catches “are the rats hogging the bedsheets, or is the yoga mat all lumps?”
		“Fuck off, Lewis.”
		“Hey, hey, look” as he extracts a crumpled receipt-paper, unfolds, sips a rioja, “I wrote 
	you a poem.”
		“Oh, Christ—”
		Lewis clears his throat, whispers into his wine glass, and the bartender overhears 
		<i>dear esther, 
			here you are in polaroids:
			we couldn’t do a thing for her
			she doesn’t believe in conditioner
			her curls and nosering live alone—</i>
		“So kind,” she chuckles, “is this romance?”
		“If there’s a compliment in it, then it’s romance. If I’m tearing you down, it’s love, and 
	it’s real.”
		“Yeah, by the way, how’s hallmark? Or are you showrunning the new Dickens anthology show 
	on PBS?”
		<i>ha ha ha</i> Lewis and Esther wheezing <i>ha ha ha</i> coals leaking sparks in a blocked 
	fireplace 
		Lewis Gina Davis, in full, breathless and “will he publish a poetry collection” and “will it 
	be called Panasonic?” and “how about tales from the colour television? for your anthology?” <i>ha ha ha</i>
		finger-snaps puncture their costume box conversation as across the room a quartet floats onto a 
	half-moon, a double bass splashes a drummer’s cheeks with sweat, an alto and pianist slap the bargoers’
	white mulled-wine faces and tear asunder the <i>ambience</i> with a thumping So What drill bit. They’re 
	prodding the bass into a cardiac arrest, a ex-teen scanning the maroon bricks and halogen bulbs for the 
	changes. The head is drawn out and frayed as the horn cannonballs into a solo, resolves in his first six 
	bars to resurrect Miles with a cattle prod. Lewis and Esther swivel to ponder bottle labels and the bar-
	back’s Flintstone forearms. 
		“Tell you what, I’ll buy you a drink” (Lewis, his lasso fingers draw a bartender short) “any drink,
	and” (top-knot is a war-time portrait here, but his nostrils froth and his pupils are thin) “you aren’t 
	allowed a vodka diet soda.” 
		Esther is in her fleece pocket, fishing for a big one and casting a net onto Lewis’ lighter. She 
	looks to him, to their silhouettes in the bar’s mirror: an angel in wool and corduroy, and words, heartburn 
	and a headache in a fleece. She breathes onto him, grins and orders “a mulled ginger, please.”
		“and make that two!” Lewis cries as his fingers make peace with top-knot. 
		The pair live in a lukewarm silence as they nurse their drinks, gazing onto the quartet. So What is 
	replaced with If I Were A Bell, which gifts the room to Milestones and then Dear Old Stockholm. A loose, 
	patchwork murmur of Pharaoh’s Dance leaks into the crowd, falls apart, is stitched back together, and Esther 
	whispers
		“I think I’ve gotten the idea.”
		“Yuh-huh,” Lewis nods, drains his glass mug and nibbles a toothpick. Esther matches him, asks him to 
	a movie at the Beaumont.
		“What the fuck is screening at eleven on a Tuesday?” 
		“A dollar-two-for double feature.”
		“Will either be any good?”
		“Who cares?”
		THE DEAD LIVE on a tea-stained silver screen a block south. Screen 3 is the little sister of the 
	Beaumont duplex, a converted garage with two-dozen carpeted economy seat-backs and a black-out curtain fringe. 
	Lewis and Esther splurge each on a Budweiser and resolve to share an x-rated popcorn. Concession stand bustle 
	and clamour drowns their negotiations
		<i>salted not sweet and she will die upon this but how about half and half only then no-one wins do you 
	even know what that means Lewis non-zero-sum game since when game theory deciding on theatre snacks you’re insane 
	you need institutionalised Lewis sweet popcorn is a mental aptitude test and you’re failing </i>
		until Esther concedes and compromises upon a large half-and-half sack of popcorn and a Whopper pouch. 
	Their seats are front-row, mid-twenties; their sneakers sweep glass underneath aisle seats as they crawl into the 
	purple-red carpeting and slouch. 
		THE DEAD LIVE on a nameless Greek island a stone’s throw thin. We crash onto two Norwegian sailors 
	circumnavigating the globe in the wrong direction. Fitte and Sprekk live in montage, shoreside binoculars and English-
	language captioning, as their anchors are torn from an Oslo harbour bed, and sleep in Svalbard, McMurdo, South Africa, 
	a seaside tendril of the Sahara, and Morocco. The pair mistake the northern and southern fingers of the strait of 
	Gibraltar as England and France and pour through into the ‘English Channel’, throbbing with testosterone, Moroccan 
	hashish and a migraine. Their boat aimlessly runs onto a crystalline Greek shore, upon which Fitte and Sprekk lounge, 
	slow-roast and think. Their bohemian lifestyles are shattered as, a week (and forty-five minutes) on, the two finally 
	ponder seeking an escape from their classical, moonshine paradise. Six days’ drunk on inexplicably alcoholic home-
	brewed grape cider, and emulating Dali with beach-crabs and the tide, rather than a wooden spoon, Fitte and Sprekk nap 
	on the sand, slipping into REM and white-noise nightmares and a ten-second dream
		<i>as we pan onto the shoreline blurry-eyed she struggles to glimpse the undead walking out onto the rocks
	slipping as their feet touch sand Fitte moans licks Sprekk’s armpit with eyelids creased Sprekk’s lips shudder with 
	his eyelashes fluttering clamped over his eyes their groaning swims amongst a synth wave coke-downbeat score dissolves 
	into an undead moan as zombies collapse onto the pair wrestle with their forearms undead are male she whispers to Lewis 
	women never die because they go to the gym and eat their veggies is that the film is this the film is this it undead 
	have untied their ribcages and each fucks one wishbone cavern with a bubo-spotted dick and snap their bones apart and 
	write out THE DEAD LIVE on the beach as the screen cuts and a helicopter shouts behind the canvas</i>
		the screen’s bulb blinks awake. Esther mutters “Fuck, I need a piss” and climbs over Lewis into hail, 
	scaffolding and exhaust. Screen 1 lets slip a dribble of husbands and wives; Screen 2 is chained shut at the wrists. 
	At the concession stand, she treats Lewis and herself to another two Budweisers and ducks into the screen as Coneheads 
	trickles out the projection booth. A stained-glass Dan Ackroyd looks down onto her, reclined and almost sleeping, her 
	Budweiser bottle half-empty and Lewis’ half-full.
