      <p><b>whittier</b> is a desperate fruit of a gruelling, aimless summer. this was a summer in which i invariably yo-yoed 
        between hopelessness, abusing substances (see: previous item), refusing medication and 
        soaking in a vague feeling of passion, love, joy, etc. draining away through inescapable goosebumps from morning through 
      until night. </p>
      <p> i wrote section I mostly in the preceding half-year, floundering under various thumbs: chronic unease, 
        alcohol dependence and frequent compulsions to lie down on cobbled streets. i think that these were a medium through
      which i writhed and coped, while seeking an escape route. </p>
      <p> section II is a wind-swept, overcast july morning in london. we slept in earl's court and i walked into central london, 
        daydreaming. i'd been wringing dry Be Safe by the Cribs and Lee Ranaldo, and mulling over Ranaldo's spoken word poem, and wrote
        the first sentence. as i walked, i drank three coffees and finished "sock puppets", shaking, in a Pret somewhere (maybe).</p>
