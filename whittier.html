      <b>introduction</b>
      <p>whittier is a desperate fruit of a gruelling, aimless summer. this was a summer in which i invariably yo-yoed 
        between hopelessness, abusing substances (see: previous item), refusing medication and 
        soaking in a vague feeling of passion, love, joy, etc. draining away through inescapable goosebumps from morning through 
      until night. i wrote section I the preceding half-year, floundering under various thumbs: chronic unease, 
        alcohol dependence and frequent compulsions to lie down on cobbled streets. i think that these were a medium through
      which i writhed and coped, while seeking an escape route. section II is a wind-swept, overcast july morning in london. we slept in earl's court and i walked into central london, 
        daydreaming. i'd been wringing dry Be Safe by the Cribs and Lee Ranaldo, and mulling over Ranaldo's spoken word poem, and wrote
        the first sentence. as i walked, i drank three coffees and finished "sock puppets," shaking and in a Pret somewhere. i worked slowly on section III through that summer, both prior to and after london. whereas section I is a 
        nauseous pair of stagnant eyes tied down in edinburgh in agony, section III is aimlessness and expectation loosed abroad. i wrote one piece in budapest at noon,
      sweating yet glistening, in the courtyard of the Petofi writer's museum; i wrote another after a six-day bender (family holiday) in new york. i remember at times flying, hopeful. we stood in the middle of an even-numbered street in manhattan on the fourth of july,
        and saw fireworks soar across the hudson river. i slept twelve hours and walked onto three bridges the next morning, and stood. i lose my words
      when i think about section IV. in those two pieces, i tried to tie a bow around a life, and from only three ribbons. i can't make it out, beyond
      a vague chest-pain which screams insincerity, pretention and hopelessness. it's winter, somehow, and i often glance back and pick at this knot; i unravel it and still find this, 
        cobwebs and dust. </p>
