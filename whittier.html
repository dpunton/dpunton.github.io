    <div>
      <b>introduction</b>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px"> whittier is a desperate fruit of a gruelling, aimless summer. this was a summer in which i invariably yo-yoed 
        between hopelessness, abusing substances (see: previous item), refusing medication and 
        soaking in a vague feeling of passion, love, joy, etc. draining away through inescapable goosebumps from morning through 
        until night. i wrote section I the preceding half-year, floundering under various thumbs: chronic unease, 
        alcohol dependence and frequent compulsions to lie down on cobbled streets. i think that these were a medium through
        which i writhed and coped, while seeking an escape route. i peer back to these pieces now and see blue, and i breathe an embarrassment masquerading
        as hate. section II is a wind-swept, overcast july morning in london. we slept in earl's court and i walked into central london, 
        daydreaming. i'd been wringing dry Be Safe by the Cribs and Lee Ranaldo, and mulling over Ranaldo's spoken word poem, and wrote
        the first sentence. as i walked, i drank three coffees and finished <i>sock puppets</i>, shaking and in a Pret somewhere. i worked slowly on section III 
        through that summer, both prior to and after london. whereas section I is a nauseous pair of stagnant eyes tied down in edinburgh in agony, 
        section III is aimlessness and expectation loosed abroad. i wrote one piece in budapest at noon, sweating yet glistening, in the 
        courtyard of the Petofi writer's museum; i wrote another after a six-day bender (family holiday) in new york. i remember at times flying, hopeful. we stood in the 
        middle of an even-numbered street in manhattan on the fourth of july, and saw fireworks soar across the hudson river. i slept twelve hours and walked onto three bridges 
        another morning, and stood. i lose my words when i think about section IV. in those two pieces, i tried to tie a bow around a life, and from only three ribbons. i can't 
        make it out, beyond a vague chest-pain which screams insincerity, pretension and hopelessness. it's winter, somehow, and i often glance back and pick at this knot; i unravel 
        it and still find this, cobwebs and dust. </p>

            <b>1</b> film reel unraveling, each frame shuddering—
              “We can do the ‘cry-on-the-doorstep’ thing, if you want,” she says, in
            platform Docs, in a corduroy skirt, in a strapped tee, with shaved snakeskin,
            with no bra. He crumples (this, under an olive canopy all numbers, no words,
            with eyes crackling red, quiz show buzzers), a paper maché confetti shred
            sputtering on the flattop sidewalk. We’ll say it’s humid, steam as air.
              “Is that a yes?” She’s perched, arms folded, baby’s legs akimbo. We’ll
            ignore his tears drifting onto the concrete, ignore a spring swimming into the
            gutter.
              “Do you want a hug?” She squats without swaying, without a breath or a
            sigh, and cradles him. Hear, as her joints are creaking, a tin-box banshee moan,
            a corrugated iron sheet rattle; spot, if we are careful and pointed, one-ply yarn
            tied off to each knuckle, hers and his, soaring up and away. We tear open the
            younger scars in the canopy over their heads; a storm, once-in-a-lifetime, is
            pushed in and vomits rain onto their hair. Emulsion on the sidewalk. Storm-
            cloud shutters impede a spotlight sun. They flee upstairs, into an apartment.

            <b>3</b> Cut like microscope slide to intersection, midnight mascara at six p.m. Our
            Village, still puffing a steam concerto; our mice, still crawling, bow under
            crosswalk signal men.
              Our red-eye Man—
              “Dinner?”
              and, pause, our Woman—
              “Am I hungry?”
              “I don’t know.”
              “Where do we go from here?”
              “What do you think?”
              “I’m not sure.”
              “I can decide,” he says, panting, “I can decide for you.”
              “I love you.”
              Hand in hand, hers in his, they cross the crosswalk; they plunge into side
            streets, into dimmer, colder crevices. Our moon is collapsing behind railroad
            faces, behind hollow fire escapes.
              “I can lead us,” he says, “to a Mexican place that I’ve heard something
            about.”
              “Do we like Mexican food?”
              “I don’t know. The something is tostadas, I think.”
              “What are tostadas? Do we like tostadas?”
              “I’m not sure. I haven’t eaten Mexican, not once.”
              “Me neither.”
              A taxi is careening down the avenue, slides into an intersection. They wait
            at the signal. The taxi strikes a steel triplet arranged inside the crosswalk box—
            first, second, third, punching home, lamppost two feet aside man and woman.
            From caverns cobbled with dumpster bags and beer cans—police cars, fire
            trucks, ambulances. Our dollars dissolve in a drain, frothing and soapy, and we
            focus, as they do, on a neon tostada, a shimmer draped atop windowpane.
            Yellow tape obscures, then a fire hose, a rosy cross, a navy paper sheet.
              Someone, from nowhere that we see—
              “No Mexican.”
              She spins, meets him, says—
              “I don’t like Mexican, I suppose.”
              “Me neither. I can lead us to a Lebanese place that’s someplace nearby.”
              They spin, on a dais, and we’ll come back to them as they fade into a still
            Polaroid picture—Lebanese place, nameless, unwired and unplumbed,
            decorated with corrugated iron sheet cheeks and a dime-paper sign shrieking
            CLOSED.
              “I don’t think I like Lebanese food either.”
              “Me neither,” he says, “Walk us to that Italian place we like.”
              “We always eat Italian.”
              “Not always, only for dinner.”
              “We always eat Italian for dinner.”
              “I know,” sigh, “So?”
              We blink, falling out, in. She says—
              “I don’t know the way.”
              “Me neither.”
              “I don’t know where it is.”
              “I know, me neither.”

            <b>6</b> Vacuum cleaner moan, bald Siamese yelp, panting, heaving—crash onto jet
            matte PVC.
              A hoarse scream, a drone like smalltalk radio. Fixed on PVC, our image is
            hazier, sluggish, in Victorian rotoscope. Tears, as many as we can dredge up,
            leaking through skin, dripping onto plastic, onto lens. He’ll gasp, whimpering,
            dribbling white noise as we duct tape his mouth.
              “Good girl,” she breathes, “I love you.”
            Pubic scribbles poke through polished folds of skin; she bends down,
            back to camera, and licks, moaning, panting; and licks, as the camera is
            unmoving and focused on his curls, his ballpoint nest swelling, writhing; as the
            camera is stuck, until he gets off.
              “You hold out for longer every time,” she says, and licks as hot pink flesh
            rolls in from the West, like a curtain, and we blink, and they’re gone.

            <b>5</b> Ash spill. Cigarette burns on the film reel. Twins, seared into faces, his, then
            hers. Crosslegged, in our chairs, at our table, she says—
              “I used to like rioja, but I can’t see why. It just tastes like white wine,”
            and he says—
              “I used to be able to tell apart whiskies on a world map. I used to tell you
            all the differences. Do you remember?”
              “No.”
              “Me neither.”
              Enter Waiter. Waistcoat inner pocket reveals a pair of vodka glasses, yang
            and yin, straight, with ice. We shower them with six more, as they line them up
            before themselves, their rows like goosebumps on castle walls. We descend
            with them, into sepia, floor by floor, like wax sealing our eardrums, like
            envelope skin; floor by floor, our image collapses into saltwater sewage;
            collapses, until we can go no further, and our image is a drowned canvas, our
            ears buried in sand.

            <b>2</b> Woman in a bathroom mirror, fish-eyed lens behind glass. She paints over
            herself, quick, hand trembling; scores herself with blush and rouge until her
            mascara pours red, down her cheeks, between her lips.
              “It tastes so sweet, like molasses. Why?” she asks us, but knows her
            audience is no one, only her. Our lighting is like hospital lighting, sterile, safe,
            and chases mascara through her lips, through her throat; and pours from her
            eyes, and into us.
              Jeans, underwear, legs, all duck under the frame as she squats. See her, in
            profile. She sighs, and lets a smile fall through her; a smile with teeth, marbled,
            sandstone teeth. Hear him, his footing, panting, unseen—
              “Sorry. I’ve never seen you shit. I didn’t know you did. I’m sorry.”
              Eyes closed as a door slams, our lens shudders.
              “I’m sorry. I’ll shit, I shit anyways, I do. I swear.”
              “Many do,” she whispers, “Most, even.”
              “So many,” he whispers, “We shit everyday, and lose something of
            ourselves everytime, everyday. Our sewers are catacombs stuffed with ill-fitting
            jigsaw puzzle pieces.”
              “I didn’t know this. Who told you this?”
              “I don’t know. I read it somewhere, I think. I don’t remember. Do you

            <b>4</b> The camera is blind. Hear—
              “I never cared for Paul McCartney.”
              “No, you never cared for the Beatles.”
              “Who do I care for?”
              “Me.”
              “Are you sure?”
              “Yes.”
              “Who else do I care for?”
              “I don’t know.”
              “I think I liked someone else, sometime, once.”
              “I was fourteen once, too.”
              “Was I fourteen once?”
              “I think so. I think we’re all fourteen, but only once.”
              “I think I was fourteen for eighteen years. I think I liked John Coltrane
            when I was fourteen, and Charlie Parker, and Dizzy Gillespie.”
              “Dizzy Gillespie practiced on the Williamsburg bridge, just down the
            road. Did you know this?”
              “Fascinating. I’m fascinated.”
              “He named an album, ‘The Bridge,’ after the Williamsburg bridge.”
              The camera is blind.
              “Do you want to leave?”
              “Yes.”
              “Do you want to get dinner?”

            <b>7</b> Untie this all into greyscale, lens centred. A fleshy pair on a corner couch,
            reupholstered. Soot scattered like salt over dark-cheeked floorboards; lighter
            walls.
              Hang upon them as they pour into us.
              She swivels, doesn’t meet him, says—
              “We don’t talk at home.”
              “We’re talking now.”
              “We don’t talk at home anymore.”
              “We’re watching a movie.”
              “What about yesterday?”
              “Yesterday,” his typewriter tongue, “We spoke just yesterday.”
              “And the day before that?”
              “And the day before that.”
              “And the day before the day before. I think I remember now.”
              “Are you sure?”
              “I think so. Which movie is this?”
              “I don’t know.”
              “I’m not sure either.”
              Hand guides hand to the remote. Sunlight explodes, smattered over the
            walls, over their faces, coating their eyes. The camera is blinded. Static
            whispers pare away male, female; we assume, we catch only—
              “What should we watch now? There are seven channels.”
              “And you always choose channel one.”
              “And you always choose channel four.”
              “And why are we together?”
              “Channel six.”
              “Right.”
              Hang and wash ourselves with saliva—crackling, greyscale whispers.
            Frames sprint through, screaming on rusted rails, breathing steam. A click, a
            sigh, nothing, then

            Man, woman, table. In height and length, they cross their legs, and peel their
            napkins and wear them like headscarves. Sight lines? Here, speak only of trench
            lines.
              We cast lenses over their affair from across the street, prodding them with
            binoculars from the silk sheets of a bedroom on a first floor of an apartment
            building across the street.
              “Have you ever been here? It’s just superb. You can have my words on
            that, if you want, or I’ll eat them.”
              “I’d rather you ate the food—or, nothing at all, actually. Speaking of, this
            place is?”
              “I don’t know. I’ve never set foot in here, and neither have you. I’ve only
            heard that it’s just superb.”
              “They have a three-course prix-fixe.”
              “I’ve heard this from five times as many friends of mine.”
              Roll the waiter in, now, zip-tied onto rails. He cut and painted his
            hourglass figure himself, from an IKEA furniture box breathing dust in his
            closet. The waistcoat we’ve sewn brings out his eyes—tremendously.
              “Wine, sir? And, madam?”
              “White, I suppose, and her the same. Bring a bottle—any bottle. Ideally
            one weightier, like, over ten percent.”
              “Very good, sir.”
              Let the waiter off, and loose him behind the restaurant’s façade, for a
            while. Our patio is spotted with a dozen couple’s tables, all empty.
              Woman pries: “Don’t you like red wine?”
              Man sputters: “Maybe I did, once, but nowadays—”
              fade out, into green-grey kaleidoscope, open up—
              “—nowadays, red wine gives me a feeling, that I’m on the verge of
            something. These are not my words. I stole them, from somewhere.”
              “Whose are they?”
              “Does it matter?”
              “And white wine doesn’t give you this?”
              “White wine is low-calorie, low-carb. White wine leaves me slim, leaves
            physical evidence. I am on an Incan mountain path, in a rainstorm, and my
            ribcage are guide ropes.”
              “Speaking of, here is?”
              “A gewürztraminer, says our sommelier,” says our waiter, springing up,
            red-eyed. Is our house haunted?
              Cut. Start up again in twenty minutes, as their appetisers descend, another
            scene snapping into focus. We’ve missed nothing.
              He says: “The tagine is Moroccan, you know, and—”
              She says: “And one each?”
              “I love you, your keen eyes, your sharp tongue. I need and deserve it, you
            know. I’m always saying this.”
              “I know this, you know this. He knows this—”
              this about our woman—her hands are clock hands, ticking, sweeping
            from barren table-side to catwalk overhead. Her forearms are HB pencils,
            scarred hexagonal by raised veins. Our spotlight spills over them. We zoom in,
            onto polished plates, beads of sweat, yellowed white-streaked teeth, empty
            plates—
              “—that I am a lifeguard, perched atop electrical cables strung up across
            your beach—that I am a Buddha—that I am a prescription lens, that my shape
            is your shape. You are double sighted. You are blind.”
              “I love you, your keen words, your sharp ideas. My head is dry, my words
            tumbleweeds. Your repetitions are lip balm.”
              “I know.”
              “Your words age like frozen sourdough bread.”
              “I know. Speaking of, where is—”
              “The bread? Needless. Our tagines—”
              “—enrobe a water porridge”—waiter, from where? from a tape cassette—
            “and assuredly not a milk porridge, not oat milk, not any milk.”
              “Why?”
              “Because milk porridge is decadent, and excessive. You feel your
            stomach’s skin heave and tear, like a lead balloon. Sinew, like pulled pork. You
            are a pig. Hook yourself up to the feeding tube, why don’t you? your foie gras
            belly. You’re a pig.”
              “These are your words?”
              “Most of them. They rarely are.”
              “Speaking of, here was?”
              “—ah, yes, madam, ah, a porridge adorned, notice, with chopped bananas
            and raisins. They wink and grin at you, like Mayan gold and Kaaba
            marshmallows. Spaghetti-O sculpture is out, you know, and porridge as plaster
            is a recipe past, and—”
              man’s fingers are tendrils, coiling, shovelling wallpaper paste—
              woman is a sculpture—
              man hardens. His armhairs are sobbing—
              “—and why not peanut butter? Because peanut butter is unharmonious,
            and excessive—and why not cashew butter? Because cashew butter is
            unexperienced, unsafe. Cashews lie and wait behind every street door and under
            every cobblestone and square inch of tarmac, like pebbles on a flooded
            mountain path.”
              veer off, and fade into black screen—birds chirping—leaves rustling—
            tombstones scraping. An underground subway train, whistling—a local train,
            flapping, plunging into bedrock—
              “—speaking? Do you remember this? Do you remember speaking?”
              “Of course, yes, I do. I am always saying this, I do. That waiter just
            leaves my tongue tossing and turning, is all, in so many knots, like Rapunzel’s
            bedsheets—”
              “—and that’s enough. These are your words? They’re awful.”
              “They always are. They shudder with rigor mortis as they sprout their
            crooked wings and swim away. I’m a pig, you know, writhing—”
              “Dream of me, why don’t you? Here, now, everything is a foam party.
            Sink beneath and feel my shape. Picture me, contour and serif. I’ll whisper my
            words to you.”
              Man, wide-eyed, murmurs—
              “Eat words, drink ideas. These are my repetitions, to hemorrhage and
            consolidate. We are treading water in the midst of winter, and I shed fat, and
            skin, like fur. I will not hibernate. I eviscerate myself, tear off and choke up
            soulful chunks to serve on copper platters to family, strangers, friends. And I
            blame the tomatoes. These are my words. My ribcage is my siege walls. All
            mine.”
              “I know. I recognised as much as you spoke those first four words.
            They’re awful, it’s all so awful.”
              “I know this. Where is our second course?”
              “This was our second course—words, ideas.”
              “Of course. Where is our third course?”
              “In his hands, I’d hope,” permits our Woman as she pins her paper straw
            forearms up, to 11 o’clock. Hear an elbow belch, like blu-tac, and pan, up high,
              and blink—
              and see—Waiter is a rubber man among rafters—a rosy inflatable,
            deflated—Waiter is a puddle, dripping through a catwalk. Is our Waiter lighter
            than air?
              “Fine, by me. I’m not hungry, not really—” to an arched eyebrow—
              “Honestly, I’m all filled up, like a lead balloon. I’ve come to realise that I have
            a small stomach, one that I don’t listen to, that I need to listen to.”
              Woman sighs—“While I’m right here?” as she draws a nose up, and a
            winter jacket from where? from underneath the table.
              “Wait,” says our Man, “Wait, just for a moment. This one is new—”
              cut to black plastic tabletop—
              notebook page pops into frame, like a ceramic beaver—
              read it—

                  cop a feel—
                  smooth a shirt—and run
                  your tip through hairy reeds—
                  sailing—brace and heave
                  and—stroking sweat like dress shirt sleeves—
                  smooth the heartache surf
                  with a butter knife
                  breath.

                  wink, moan—
                  twirl your hair—and put up
                  curls in a tissue vice—
                  marching—stumble up
                  and—scraping off bound, rotted soles—
                  crack a hydrant—run
                  a toe in lukewarm stagnant
                  water.

              Woman nods: “I like it. What’s it called?”
              “It’s nameless. Finished things have names.”
              “It’s unfinished? How can I tell?”
              “You can’t tell? My breath is uneven, even now. My thoughts travel on a
            rail as I read, through a landscape that peels off like leaves in autumn. These
            words are my words, but their rhythm doesn’t meet my heartbeat—not in the
            last. This is how I can tell—”
              let the sound off—
              let a boom mic lick a drain—
              hang here, just for the moment—
              “Why?” she, through grease and cholera.
              “Why what? Why these words? I’m all words, now. I have acne,
            everywhere. Bleached notebook pages break out every day, like scales.”
              “Why is it unfinished? I mean only this—why is it unfinished—”
              fall into silence again, then—
              “I don’t know how to end it.” whispers our Man as we
              fade into cable static, and
              dislodge our binoculars—

              feed our blurry window, with
              a red eye and wailing tin-can ears—

              smash cut to a slideshow—now—and
              hear four ukulele chords—

              here’s a pair of skate shoes, and
              a big toe sprouting out each—

              here’s a cup of black coffee, and
              a polyester hair ball treading water—

              here’s a double bed, and
              bedsheets, and a laptop—

              hear a breaker, lightbulbs winking
              out, rain machines clocking out—

              walk us up, to a ceiling, to
              catch a soundstage star
              
              soaring by, winking out.

            here’s my sticky sky blue pottery wheel—
            after twenty-one hours, i’m retiring.

            it’s cold—my fingertips are chessmen, now—
            and, you know, I never bothered crocheting.

            here’s a holey blanket—
            after hitching squares, card spines aching.

            it’s gnawed—my ends are frayed, now—
            and reek of damp, and rusting.

            here’s my empty stomach—
            after sowing bricks and webbing, i’m yielding.
